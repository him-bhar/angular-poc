<!-- The $http Service
     The $http service is one of the most common used services in AngularJS applications. 
     The service makes a request to the server, and lets your application handle the response. 
     
     Response Properties
     The response from the server is an object with these properties:

     .config the object used to generate the request.
     .data a string, or an object, carrying the response from the server.
     .headers a function to use to get header information.
     .status a number defining the HTTP status.
     .statusText a string defining the HTTP status.
-->

<body>
  <form name="myForm" ng-app="myApp">
    <div ng-controller="httpCtrl">
      <h3>{{httpResponse}}</h3>
    </div>

    <p>This example uses the built-in $http service to get the absolute url of the page.</p>
