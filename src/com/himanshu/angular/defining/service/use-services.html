<!-- What is a Service?
     In AngularJS, a service is a function, or object, that is available for, and limited to, your AngularJS application.
     AngularJS has about 30 built-in services. One of them is the $location service. -->
<body>
  <form name="myForm" ng-app="myApp">
    <div ng-controller="locationCtrl">
      <p>The url of this page is:</p>
      <h3>{{myUrl}}</h3>
    </div>

    <p>This example uses the built-in $location service to get the absolute url of the page.</p>
